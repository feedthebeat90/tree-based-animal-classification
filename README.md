# Project - Classification Trip to the Animal Kingdom (tentative title)

As a project instructor, you will work in the `develop` branch of the project. Here is the project's `develop` dashboard (where you also can preview the project):

The `master` branch, which you will be locked out of, contains the content students will see when the project goes live. Here is the project's `master` dashboard:

# Your to-do list

Everything that needs to be done to launch your project is broken down into tasks in the Asana to-do list below:

The red tasks are for instructors and the blue tasks are for your DataCamp contact. Your DataCamp contact will assign due dates throughout the creation process for your project. All you need to do is report your progress on each task by clicking the checkbox on its left-hand side when complete. Asana training shouldn't be necessary, but here is an Asana [quick start guide](https://asana.com/guide/get-started/begin/quick-start) guide just in case.

# Things to install and configure

There are some packages you need to be able to create DataCamp projects locally. Run the following commands in a terminal to install them.

*You might need to change pip into pip3 depending on how you installed python.*

```
pip install nose
pip install git+https://github.com/datacamp/ipython_nose
pip install jupytext --upgrade
```

After that, open `project.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook, then click "File" -> "Jupytext" -> "Pair Notebook with Markdown".
